# Email Notification Fix - Appointment Approval

## Issue
When admin approved appointments, users were not receiving email notifications despite the email functionality being implemented in the codebase.

## Root Cause
The appointment status update route (`/api/appointments/:id`) in `backend/routes/appointments.js` was missing the email sending functionality. The email logic existed in `backend/controllers/appointmentController.js` but was not being used by the actual route that handles appointment status updates.

## Solution
✅ **FIXED**: Integrated the email sending functionality directly into the appointment status update route.

### Changes Made:

1. **`backend/routes/appointments.js`** (lines 137-147):
   - Added email sending when appointment status is updated to "approved"
   - Integrated `sendAppointmentApproved` function from mailer utility
   - Added proper error handling (email failure won't break the status update)
   - Added logging for successful email sending

2. **`backend/utils/mailer.js`** (lines 37-57):
   - Enhanced error handling and debugging
   - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Improved email error reporting

## Verification
✅ **Email Configuration**: Confirmed that `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` environment variables are properly set
✅ **Email Functionality**: Successfully tested email sending (message ID: `60bbb56f-2a2a-aab0-f624-59d7d10773ce`)
✅ **SMTP Connection**: Gmail SMTP connection working correctly

## How It Works Now
1. Admin approves appointment through frontend
2. Frontend calls `PATCH /api/appointments/:id` with `status: 'approved'`
3. Backend updates appointment in database
4. Backend automatically sends approval email to user
5. User receives confirmation email with appointment details

## Deployment
The fix has been committed to the branch `cursor/fix-appointment-approval-email-notification-50c1`.

**To deploy to production:**
1. Push the branch to your repository
2. If using Render auto-deploy, the changes will be deployed automatically
3. If manual deployment is needed, trigger a new deployment on your hosting platform

## Email Template
Users will receive an email with:
- Subject: "Your Appointment is Approved"
- Appointment details (service, date/time)
- Contact information
- Professional styling with Odamz Royal branding

## Error Handling
- If email sending fails, the appointment status will still be updated successfully
- Email errors are logged for debugging
- No user-facing errors if email fails (graceful degradation)
